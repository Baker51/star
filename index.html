    <h1 class="bodytextfilm">ðŸª¶ Hyapatia Lee <span class="boldtype">is the founder of Native Strength,</span> an alternative approach to the contemporary mental health care system based on ancient wisdom. This path to happiness and personal evolvement is based on a centuries-old, inter-tribal system given to us by the Star People. <span class="boldtype">Information is shared with the help of medicine wheels,</span> which are much like the circles that the aliens in the movie ARRIVAL used to communicate with humans.</h1> 
    
<hr>

    
    <h1 class="bodytextfilm">ðŸª¶ Hyapatia began her research with medicine men and women across North America in the mid-1980's. She incorporated what she had learned to help <span class="boldtype">the people of The Lost River Band of the Cherokees in Mitchell, Indiana as their Blessed Woman for years to come.</span></h1> 
    <hr>

    <h1 class="bodytextfilm">ðŸª¶ While traveling, Hyapatia took time to study on reservations with medicine men and women and wise elders.  These elders have since passed and it has become obvious that sharing this information is imperative to its preservation.</span></h1> 


    <img class="mastheadtitle" src="images/medicinewheelcirclesoflife_words.jpg" alt="Wheel of Life chart with words picture">


    <h1 class="bodytextfilm">ðŸª¶ After seeing how much <span class="boldtype">these medicine wheel teachings</span> helped the people of the Lost River Band, Hyapatia received permission from the elders to write these <span class="boldtype">five books</span> (listed below) on which the Native Strength TV series is based.
